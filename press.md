        <p><!-- <span class="image left"><img src="images/intech_cbs.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->Just a week or two out of school and some middle school students are back in the classroom — on a college campus. The room full of middle school girls on North Carolina State University’s campus aren’t playing games or posting on social media, they’re learning to build their own websites. <a href="http://intech.camp/cbsraleigh" target="_blank">Watch Now</a></p>

        <p>Khalia Braswell, a 2013 NC State computer science graduate, started a nonprofit organization called INTech to expose middle-school aged girls to coding. INTech has hosted several camps in Charlotte, as well as numerous cities in South Carolina and California, and held its first camp at NC State in June. Several current students from and recent graduates of the Department of Computer Science volunteered to work the camp. <a href="http://intech.camp/ncsu-coenews" target="_blank">Read More</a></p>

        <p>This year, to my surprise, I received an email from INTech saying I’d been identified as one of their inspiring people. They wanted me to speak with a group of middle school girls at a mini-camp to be held during Engineers Week, Feb 19–25, 2017. I jumped at the opportunity. And it was awesome! INTech Camp does very important work in inspiring young girls — but nationally, there’s still a lot of work to be done.<a href="http://intech.camp/BlankaRV" target="_blank"> Read More</a></p>
